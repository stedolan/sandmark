Simple example of async usage.

~ Use build_echo.sh to build an echo server

  - echo_server_main.native 
     * server : receive connection and resend what it receives

  - echo_client_main.native 
     * client connect to server and send 1000 string with random length

  - echo_merge.native 
     * runs both the server and client
