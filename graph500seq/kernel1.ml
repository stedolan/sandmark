(*Kernel 1 is basic construction of adjacency HashMap for undirected graphs which is corresponding to sparse graph implementation. INPUTS : ijw and m which has been 
derived from kronecker product*)

(*(*<-------OCaml Kernel 1 inspired from https://graph500.org/?page_id=12---------->
Written by support of PRISM Lab, IIT Madras and OCaml Labs*)*)

(*This function helps in transpose of the list which has to be converted from (startVertex, endVertex, weight) in column to (startVertex, endVertex, weight) in 3 rows*)

let scale = int_of_string Sys.argv.(1)
let edgefactor = int_of_string Sys.argv.(2)

let rec transpose list col newList =
  if col = 3 then newList
  else
    let rec transposeRow row rowList =
      if row = List.length list then rowList
      else
        transposeRow (row + 1) (rowList @ [ List.nth (List.nth list row) col ])
    in
    transpose list (col + 1) (newList @ [ transposeRow 0 [] ])

(*This basically sorts the list in a way that (startVertex, endVertex), startVertex > endVertex.*)

    | [] -> (newList, int_of_float maximum)

            (max maximum y)
  in
  sortVerticeList list newList 0.

(*As the name suggests, it removes the self loops from ijw*)
let rec removeSelfLoops ijw newList col m =
  if col = m then newList
  else if List.nth (List.nth ijw 0) col = List.nth (List.nth ijw 1) col then

        ] )

(*This is basically the construction of adj matrix [row][col], just in case dense graphs are being tested. All the kernels further though use HashMap, and thus would 
require changes*)
