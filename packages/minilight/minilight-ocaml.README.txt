Description
-----------

MiniLight is a minimal global illumination renderer. See the main MiniLight
readme for a general description.




Installation
------------

### Requirements ###

* MacOS 10.5 or GNU/Linux (to run)
* OCaml 4.00 (to build)


### Guide ###

Simply copy minilight-ocaml file to wherever.

The program reads the model file given and creates and writes the image file
requested; nothing else is touched.




Building
--------

It is an ordinary simple build. There are no special requirements or
dependencies: Everything needed is in the supplied archive (assuming the build
environment and tools are already prepared).

For Mac or Linux, run the make/build-ocaml.sh script. Both are for OCaml
version 3.xx or 4.00 .

(For 32bit Intel targets, add the -ffast-math option to the compile command.)

Run scripts from the 'ocaml' directory.
