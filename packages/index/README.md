Index is a scalable implementation of persistent indices in OCaml.

It takes an arbitrary IO implementation and user-supplied content types 
and supplies a standard key-value interface for persistent storage. 

Index supports instance sharing:
each OCaml runtime can share a common singleton instance.

Index supports multiple-reader/single-writer access.
Concurrent access is safely managed using lock files.
